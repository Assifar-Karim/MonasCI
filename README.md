# MonasCI

MonasCI is a tool that aims to simplify the process of creating and managing CI/CD pipelines for your projects. It uses a model-driven engineering approach to generate CI/CD pipeline configurations for multiple CI/CD platforms, including GitLab CI, CircleCI, and others. (for the momements, we support GitLab CI, CircleCI: wait for next realeses)

## Features

* Provides a unified approach to creating and managing CI/CD pipelines across multiple projects and platforms.
* Uses a model-driven engineering approach to generate pipeline configurations, making it easy to understand and maintain.
